Image compression using K-means clustering and interactive jupyter notebook tools

Image compression is achieved using K-means clustering algorithm. 

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.

In order to reduce the computation time, MiniBatchKMeans algorithm is used here from sklearn. 

In order to see the results in an interactive way, the jupyter widgets are made use of and interactively, the k value can be changed in order to view the results of the Algorithm.
